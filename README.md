# Test app for mifare classic nested auth

## Disclaimer

If you don't know what this is for please leave this repo alone :).
The code is kinda shit because this wasn't originally planned to be publicly released, it was developed as a test app for a PR.

## Testing instructions

- Load `tag.bin` to a magic tag;
- `ufbt launch`;
- Press center button;
- Verify that "Test successful" gets displayed.
